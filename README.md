election-2011
=============

This was an election-night infographic I designed and coded while interning at WBEZ. It garnered the most page views on election night. 

This project uses RaphaelJS (http://raphaeljs.com/) and HTML image maps to create a vector map of Chicago's wards in 2011. 

To complete this project, I started with a vector PDF of Chicago's wards from the city's website. I cleaned it up in Illustrator and exported the map to an SVG file. This gave me the coordinates I needed to accurately display the complex shapes of each ward.
